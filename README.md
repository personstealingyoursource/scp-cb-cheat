# scp-cb-cheat
cheat for scp cb 1.3.11

how to install
1. download the thing
2. make a backup of your scp cb data folder
3. extract the data dir to your scp cb folder, confirm replacement
4. do literally nothing
its recommended to start a new game since i hadn't tested it with save games made before editing the files

features
1. scps are "slower" (their speed is -50k so probably slower)
2. rooms that are required for completing the game are more common

note: due to rooms being more common, some of them may clone and turn into "ghost" rooms, they still have the items and can be entered normally by scps but their events are gone

to uninstall this simply put your old scp cb data folder back in
this mod cannot be toggled off ingame, when you uninstall you must start a new game
